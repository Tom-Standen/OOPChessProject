# OOPChessProject

During my MPHYS at UoM I decided to take a module on object-oriented programming in C++. The task was to create a game engine that demonstrates the following properties of OOP: 
<ul>
  <li> Class structure </li>
  <li> Abstraction </li>
  <li> Inheritance </li>
  <li> Polymorphism </li>
  <li> Encapsulation </li>
  <li> Templating </li>
</ul>

The program used a number of header and source files and was compiled using Visual Studio 2013 as required by the course.
