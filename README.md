# OOPChessProject

During my MPHYS at UoM I decided to take a module on object-oriented programming in C++. There are a number of dated branches from this master that show how the project developed. The version of the program that was submitted is in the branch "Complete".

Annoyingly the 4/20 code is included in lots of the branches, but just ignore it. 

The program used a number of header and source files and was compiled using Visual Studio 2013 as required by the course.
